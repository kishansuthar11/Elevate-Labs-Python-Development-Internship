# Elevate-Labs-Python-Development-Internship
A simple Python-based project created during my Elevate Labs Python Development Internship.
Task 001: Calculator
How My Calculator Program Works
I have made a Calculator class that has functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

The program first asks the user to enter two numbers.

After that, it shows a small menu where you can choose which operation you want to perform.

According to the choice, it runs the correct function and shows the result.

I also handled cases like dividing by zero, so it doesnâ€™t crash and shows a proper message.

If the user enters something wrong (like an alphabet or an invalid option), it asks again.

The program keeps running in a loop, so you can do multiple calculations until you press 0 to exit.
